# mcpdeploy

**Deploy MCP servers without touching infrastructure.**

mcpdeploy is a micro-SaaS that turns any GitHub repository containing an MCP server into a live, production-ready HTTPS URL — in about 30 seconds.

No Docker. No Kubernetes. No config files to learn.

## What we're building

The **"Vercel for MCP"** — a simple, fast, and affordable hosting solution for AI developers and teams who want to test, host, or share their Model Context Protocol servers without wasting time on infrastructure.

### How it works

1. **Connect GitHub** — we see your MCP repos
2. **Pick a repository** — the one with your MCP server
3. **Deploy** — we build it and give you a `https://your-mcp.mcp.mcpdeploy.dev` URL

Push to `main` and your MCP auto-redeploys. Scale-to-zero on the free tier. Always-on for $20/month.

## Current status

🚧 **In beta** — actively looking for early users and feedback.

If you're building with MCP and tired of manually hosting your servers, [give it a try](https://mcpdeploy.dev) and let us know what breaks (or what works).

## Why we built this

Hosting an MCP server shouldn't require a DevOps degree. We wanted something as simple as pushing code to GitHub — and getting a URL back. That's it.

If you've ever thought _"I just want to deploy this thing and move on"_, this is for you.
